This paper explores the potential of some popular machine learning methods for predicting borrowers' default on auto loans. Typically, banks and other lending institutions use a logistic regression algorithm as part of their decision-making process, however, more advanced methods have also proven to be effective in classifying default forecasts for loans. The data used contains information on loan agreements, historical information on credit transactions and their status, as well as anonymized personal information on nearly 200,000 car loan borrowers in China.
